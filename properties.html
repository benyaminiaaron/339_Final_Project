The room is in the basement, the only bedroom on that floor. Shared bathroom (also brand new) with one other housemate, though there may not be anyone living in that room this summer so it might be a personal bathroom.
                <br> <br>
                Kitchen and living room will be fully furnished for the whole summer. Bedroom can be left fully furnished or entirely empty.
